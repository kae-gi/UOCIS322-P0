Description: Prints out "Hello world." Also changed the Makefile to move credentials.ini from main directory to hello folder for autograder.

**NOTE**: I initially turned in the assignment on time, however just recently (Tues @ 8:30pm or so... did not see on Slack due to class + other school work + job) found out that the Makefile needed to be changed as well AFTER the stated push changes deadline of Tues 4pm.
